# How to Contribute to Lingua ad Intellegendum

Thank you for your interest in this project. *Lingua ad Intellegendum* is fundamentally a collaborative endeavor. Its success depends on the collective expertise of researchers, linguists, philosophers, and practitioners who can help validate and refine this taxonomy.

As the project maintainers, our role at **TeeZe Solutions** is to facilitate discussion and maintain the project's structure, not to act as the final authority on terminology. The goal is for the community to build and validate this lexicon together.

## Guiding Principles

To ensure the quality and integrity of the taxonomy, all contributions should adhere to these core principles:

1.  **Grounded in Observation:** Proposals must be tied to observable phenomena in LLMs, not purely speculative concepts.
2.  **Clarity and Precision:** Definitions should be unambiguous and avoid anthropomorphic language wherever possible.
3.  **Community Consensus is Key:** Substantive changes will be integrated only after a clear consensus has emerged from community discussion.
4.  **Respect the Existing Taxonomy:** Proposed terms should be checked against existing ones to avoid duplication and ensure they fit coherently within the overall structure.

## The Contribution Workflow: From Idea to Integration

Because this project is about building a shared understanding, **all substantive contributions must begin in GitHub Discussions.** This is where ideas are proposed, debated, and validated by the community.

### Step 1: Check for Existing Proposals

Before creating a new discussion, please review the **[Terms Under Review](TERMS_UNDER_REVIEW.md)** file to see if a similar term is already being debated. This helps prevent duplicate proposals.

### Step 2: Start a Discussion

If your idea is new, please **[start a new Discussion](https://github.com/teeze-solutions/Lingua-aI/discussions/new)** using the "Ideas" category.

### Step 3: Structure Your Proposal

To facilitate a productive debate, please structure any proposal for a new term or a significant change using the following template in your discussion post:

> **Term:** *[Proposed Latin Term]*
>
> **Definition:** *[A clear, concise English definition.]*
>
> **Rationale:** *[Why is this term needed? What gap does it fill in the current taxonomy?]*
>
> **Observable Evidence:** *[Describe a specific, observable LLM behavior that this term captures. Provide an example prompt/response if possible.]*
>
> **Relation to Existing Terms:** *[How does this differ from or relate to existing terms in the taxonomy?]*

### Step 4: Community Review and Refinement

This is the most critical phase. Other community members are encouraged to review the proposal, ask clarifying questions, provide counter-examples, and help refine the definition. The goal is to reach a state of general agreement among several knowledgeable participants.

### Step 5: Submitting a Pull Request (The Final Step)

**Please do not submit a pull request without first achieving consensus in a discussion.**

Once a discussion has reached a clear consensus and a maintainer has acknowledged it, a pull request can be opened to integrate the change into the `README.md`. The pull request should be small, focused, and link back to the original discussion thread.

#### For Minor Fixes
For simple typos or formatting errors that do not change the meaning of the text, you may open an issue or submit a pull request directly.
