# Terms Under Review

This document serves as an index for new terms that have been proposed for inclusion in the *Lingua ad Intellegendum* taxonomy but have not yet been formally adopted. These terms are presented here to invite community discussion, refinement, and validation.

**These terms are not yet part of the official lexicon.**

The primary debate and refinement for each term should happen in its dedicated GitHub Discussion thread, linked below.

---

## How This Process Works

1.  **Proposal:** A new term is proposed in a **[GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/teeze-solutions/Lingua-aI/discussions)**, following the format outlined in our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).
2.  **Indexing:** A maintainer adds the term to this list and links it to the new discussion thread.
3.  **Debate & Refinement:** The community discusses the term's validity, definition, and evidence in the thread.
4.  **Adoption or Rejection:** Based on community consensus, the term is either integrated into the main `README.md` (and removed from this list) or the proposal is closed.
