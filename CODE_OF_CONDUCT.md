# Lingua ad Intellegendum - Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment for rigorous intellectual inquiry, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in the *Lingua ad Intellegendum* project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are committed to creating a space where scholarly debate can flourish, grounded in mutual respect and a shared goal of advancing knowledge.

## Our Standards

This project thrives on robust, evidence-based discussion. Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive and productive academic environment include:

*   **Maintaining a High Standard of Intellectual Rigor:** Presenting arguments clearly, citing evidence where appropriate, and engaging with topics in a thoughtful, substantive manner.
*   **Engaging in Respectful, Evidence-Based Debate:** Focusing on the content of ideas, not the individuals presenting them. Disagreeing constructively and challenging ideas without resorting to personal attacks.
*   **Gracefully Accepting Constructive Criticism:** Viewing feedback and peer review as essential components of the scientific process.
*   **Prioritizing Intellectual Honesty:** Acknowledging the limits of one's own knowledge and giving credit where it is due.
*   **Using Welcoming and Inclusive Language:** Ensuring that our discourse is accessible and respectful to a diverse, global community.
*   **Showing Empathy Towards Other Community Members:** Recognizing that participants come from varied backgrounds and disciplines.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

*   The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
*   Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
*   Public or private harassment.
*   Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission (doxing).
*   Dismissing arguments based on the identity of the author rather than the merit of the idea.
*   Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional or academic setting.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.
