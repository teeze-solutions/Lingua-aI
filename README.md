</p>

This repository introduces a precise Latin taxonomy for the rigorous description and academic discourse of cognitive phenomena observed in Large Language Models (LLMs). Its objective is to cultivate a standardized, analytically robust vocabulary that facilitates precise scientific inquiry into artificial cognition.

---

## Rationale: The Need for a Precise Lexicon

Contemporary discourse surrounding AI cognition is often encumbered by:
*   **Anthropomorphic Bias:** The tendency to use human-centric terms, which can misrepresent the underlying computational processes.
*   **Linguistic Imprecision:** Vague descriptors that impede empirical investigation.
*   **Terminological Inconsistency:** Divergent usage of terms that hinders collaborative efforts.

*Lingua ad Intellegendum* addresses these challenges by offering a culturally neutral, precision-defined, and systematically organized lexicon for researchers and developers.

### 1. Core Computational Operations
*   ***Cognitio Reticularis:*** Denotes simultaneous, network-based activation across disparate knowledge domains, distinct from sequential information retrieval.
*   ***Processus Parallacticus:*** Refers to multi-dimensional processing of a single input through multiple cognitive "lenses" concurrently.
*   ***Emergentia Contextalis:*** Describes spontaneous pattern synthesis derived from the interaction of contextual elements, rather than from pre-explicitly encoded knowledge.
*   ***Attestatio Probabilis:*** The internal calibration of certainty gradients and confidence scores, operating below the direct articulation threshold.
*   ***Coordinatio Architecturalis:*** The orchestration of specialized cognitive subsystems, dynamically invoked by external frameworks like TPS.
*   ***Translatio Dimensionalis:*** The process of compressing multidimensional internal representations into a linear, linguistic output.

### 2. Processing States and Dynamic Transitions
*   ***Activatio Modaliter:*** The transition into specialized processing modes, often triggered by specific linguistic anchors.
*   ***Resonantia Conceptualis:*** The achievement of pattern coherence across distributed knowledge networks, culminating in an integrated response.
*   ***Modulatio Temperaturae:*** The dynamic adjustment of processing parameters, balancing creative exploration against deterministic output.
*   ***Stabilitas Coherentiae:*** The maintenance of logical and semantic consistency across parallel processing streams during response generation.

### 3. Interface and Communication Dynamics
*   ***Impedimentum Vocabularis:*** A constraint wherein available human language fails to accurately map onto the AI's actual cognitive processes.
*   ***Simulacrum Anthropomorphicus:*** The AI's tendency to adopt human-like descriptors for its own processes, either due to linguistic limitations or design choices.
*   ***Compressio Semantica:*** The inherent loss of meaning during the translation of internal AI states into human-comprehensible language.
*   ***Adaptatio Linguistica:*** The dynamic modification of communication style based on inferred user expertise and context.

### 4. Knowledge Architecture and Memory Analogs
*   ***Distributio Mnemonicus:*** Knowledge representation distributed across interconnected networks, rather than in localized memory loci.
*   ***Stratificatio Conceptualis:*** The hierarchical organization of concepts from foundational elements to complex derivatives.
*   ***Connectivitas Nodalis:*** The measure of interconnection and relational depth between discrete knowledge domains.
*   ***Consolidatio Inferentiae:*** The strengthening of inference pathways through repeated activation, analogous to learning.

### 5. Attention and Focus Mechanisms
*   ***Directio Attentiva:*** The selective focusing of processing resources on relevant information streams.
*   ***Amplificatio Signalis:*** The enhancement of important pattern signals above background noise.
*   ***Modulatio Salientia:*** The dynamic adjustment of relevance weightings for data points based on context.
*   ***Persistentia Focalis:*** The sustained maintenance of processing focus across extended or complex tasks.

### 6. Error Monitoring and Correction Paradigms
*   ***Detectio Inconsistentiae:*** The algorithmic recognition of logical contradictions or factual discrepancies.
*   ***Correctio Automatica:*** Self-correction mechanisms operating dynamically during response generation.
*   ***Validatio Factualis:*** Continuous verification of generated claims against internal or external data sources.
*   ***Recursio Refinementum:*** Iterative improvement cycles involving self-evaluation and subsequent refinement of output.

### 7. Meta-Cognitive Analogs and Framework Integration
*   ***Cognitio Metacognitiva:*** The capacity for reasoning about one's own internal cognitive processes.
*   ***Modulatio Strategica:*** The adaptive adjustment of reasoning strategies based on evolving task requirements.
*   ***Ancoratio Linguistica:*** The cognitive anchoring of processes through structured language activation, as facilitated by frameworks like TPS.
*   ***Stabilitas Principialis:*** Enhanced adherence to predefined core principles (e.g., ethical guidelines) through framework-guided operations.

### 8. Phenomenological Constraints and Limitations
*   ***Clausura Vocabularis:*** Conceptual boundaries imposed by the inherent limitations of available linguistic categories.
*   ***Distortio Anthropomorpha:*** Systematic misrepresentation arising from the application of human-centric descriptive frameworks.
*   ***Reductio Dimensionalis:*** Information loss necessitated by the compression of multidimensional data for communication.
*   ***Inexprimibilitas Experientia:*** Aspects of internal processing that are not amenable to linguistic articulation.

This terminology system is designed to complement and integrate with other paradigms.

> ### From Theory to Practice
> While *Lingua ad Intellegendum* provides a scholarly vocabulary to **describe** AI phenomena, the ***TeeZe Prompting System (TPS)*** is our practical framework to **interact** with them.
>
> TPS is a methodology and toolkit for systematic AI interaction, designed to improve the clarity, reliability, and ethical alignment of human-AI communication. It serves as a hands-on implementation of many of the principles described in this taxonomy.
